# Golden-Shop
This is my database project. To keep track of the products and balanced sheets is a challenging task for a shopkeeper. This project aimed to reduce the
laborious task of the shopkeeper. A basic database management system was used for keeping track of the products and also
balance sheets. This project helped the shopkeeper to automate the stock management, billings system, and sales records.
